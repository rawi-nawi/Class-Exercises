                        <a href="London.html">London, England</a>
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Instantly recognizable icons like Big Ben and St. Paul's Cathedral welcome you to history-laden London, the UK's multicultural capital that's a tireless innovator of art and culture.

            <div class="city-wrapper">
                <h2>Rome, Italy</h2>
                <p>
                    A heady mix of haunting ruins, awe-inspiring art and vibrant street life, Italy's hot-blooded capital is one of the world's most romantic and charismatic cities.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="city-wrapper">
                <h2>Paris, France</h2>
                <p>
                    Paris' monument-lined boulevards, museums, classical bistros and boutiques are enhanced by a new wave of multimedia galleries, creative wine bars, design shops and tech start-ups.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="city-wrapper">
                <h2>Amsterdam, The Netherlands</h2>
                <p>
                    Golden Age canals lined by tilting gabled buildings are the backdrop for Amsterdam's treasure-packed museums, vintage-filled shops and hyper-creative drinking, dining and design scenes.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="city-wrapper">
                <h2>Barcelona, Spain</h2>
                <p>
                    Barcelona is an enchanting seaside city with boundless culture, fabled architecture and a world-class drinking and dining scene.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="city-wrapper">
                <h2>Athens, Greece</h2>
                <p>
                    Equal measures of grunge and grace, Athens is a master of reinvention, serving up an anarchic mash-up of architectural gravitas, urban grit and infectious creativity.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="city-wrapper">
                <h2>Lake Como, Italy</h2>
                <p>
                    Como (aka Lario) is the most ‘James Bond’ of the Italian lakes, where shiny red Ferraris weave through narrow lakeside towns and neoclassical villas take on a whole new level of opulence. Parts of the 2006 Bond movie Casino Royale were filmed here and many of the fancy lakeside hotels have a 007 price tag.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="city-wrapper">
                <h2>Madrid, Spain</h2>
                <p>
                    Madrid has excellent art museums, phenomenal food, enormous parks and Europe’s largest palace, but its inclusive atmosphere is what really makes the city soar.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="city-wrapper">
                <h2>Stockholm, Sweden</h2>
                <p>
                    Stockholmers call their city 'beauty on water'. But despite the well-preserved historic core, Stockholm is no museum piece: it's modern, dynamic and ever-evolving.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="city-wrapper">
                <h2>Lisbon, Portugal</h2>
                <p>
                    Seven cinematic hillsides overlooking the Rio Tejo cradle Lisbon's postcard-perfect panorama of cobbled alleyways, ancient ruins and white-domed cathedrals, a captivating scene crafted over centuries.
